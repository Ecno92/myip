![CI-status](https://travis-ci.org/Ecno92/myip.svg?branch=master)

## Usage

```
(whatsmyip)user@device:~/Projects/whatsmyip/bin$ ./myip --provider httpbin
240.0.0.0
```

## Goal of this project

The goal of this project is not to become the best tool to check your IP address. 
In that case I recommend you to use something more simple like:

`curl https://httpbin.org/ip`

I've developed this project to have something simple to experiment with when explorering new ideas or techniques.
